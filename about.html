            <!-- <h2>The Bhagavad Gita</h2> -->
            <p>
              Traditionally, the authorship of the Bhagavad Gita is attributed to 
              Sage Vyasa, who is also known as the compiler of the Indian epic 
              Mahabharata, where the Gita is found. The Bhagavad Gita, often referred 
              to as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the epic 
              Mahabharata, dated to the second half of the first millennium BCE and 
              is considered one of the holy scriptures for Hinduism.

                The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to simply as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the epic Mahabharata. It is written in the form of a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. This dialogue takes place on the battlefield just before the start of a great war, where Arjuna is filled with doubt and moral dilemma about fighting in the battle. Krishna imparts spiritual wisdom and guidance to Arjuna, addressing his doubts and encouraging him to fulfill his Kshatriya (warrior) duty as a fighter.
